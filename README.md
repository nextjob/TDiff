##  Description:
Component to list differences between two integer arrays using a "longest common subsequence" algorithm.            
Typically, this component is used to diff 2 text files once their individuals lines have been hashed.

The key algorithm in this component is based on:           
"An O(NP) Sequence Comparison Algorithm"  by Sun Wu, Udi Manber & Gene Myers                         
And uses a "divide-and-conquer" technique to avoid using exponential amounts of memory as described in:
